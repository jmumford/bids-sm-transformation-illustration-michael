In the behaviour logs the trial types are numeric. The following code was used. 

For session 1 runs:
Conditions: 1=csp shock; 2=csp noshock; 3=cspi; 4=csm; 5=csmi
ShockOn: 1= on; 2= off
CSorientation: orientation of the gabor being viewed OR imagined

For session 2:

The condition corresponds to the auditory instruction
Conditions: 1=csp shock; 2=csp noshock; 3=cspi; 4=csm; 5=csmi
ShockOn: 1= on; 2= off
CSorientation: orientation of the gabor being VIEWED
NB-in session 2, if the condition has an "i" that means participants were cued to imaging the noted stimulus while viewing the opposite. For example, for cspi, participants were cued to imagine the CS+ while viewing the CS- (up-regulation condition).


Sub-04 didn't return for session 2.
